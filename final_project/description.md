# Goal #
The goal is the production of a Java based program that automatically creates invoices, customer orders, and offers and stores them in a database. The program must also manage a stockpile and deduct or add articles to the warehouse based on the documents provided to it. The program additionally connects the invoices/orders/offers with people so that customer support is facilitated.

# Database #
Database contains a customer, a customer order from which an offer and/or invoice is generated.
Database contains articles that are sold in the store and tracks the amount/availability of said articles in one warehouse.
